--- Day 4: Ceres Search ---
"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the Ceres monitoring station!

As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: XMAS.

This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways XMAS might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with .:


..X...
.SAMX.
.A..A.
XMAS.S
.X....
The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:

MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX
In this word search, XMAS occurs a total of 18 times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any XMAS have been replaced with .:

....XXMAS.
.SAMXMS...
...S..A...
..A.A.MS.X
XMASAMX.MM
X.....XA.A
S.S.S.S.SS
.A.A.A.A.A
..M.M.M.MM
.X.X.XMASX
Take a look at the little Elf's word search. How many times does XMAS appear?









i want to create a circle approach, from the X letter going till 3 more indices ahead, 

horizontal forward check 
MAS 

horizontal backward check, 
SAM 

vertical down 
M
A
S

vertical up
S
M
A 

diagonal down left
      M
   A
S

diagonal down right
            M
               A
                  S

diagonal up left
          S
            A
               M

diagonal up right
          S
     A
M

so in total 8 check for 1 X letter in the circle approach

and need to do this for whole input 2d vector

and when the whole XMAS is found then need to increase the frequency
